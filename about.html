        <h2>Hi, I’m Evan.</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a photographer and creative storyteller based in Tallahassee.
        I’m drawn to real moments—the energy, emotion, and personality that make each story its own. 
        Whether I’m shooting sports, weddings, portraits, or live events, I try to bring a calm, collaborative vibe so people feel comfortable and the moments unfold naturally.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve learned that great photos come from genuine connection. When people feel at ease, they open up, and that’s when the best images happen. My goal is to create a relaxed space where you can be yourself and trust the process.

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>
      I’m drawn to authentic storytelling — the small details, the in‑between moments, 
      the things you don’t always notice in real time. My style blends clean composition 
      with natural emotion, creating images that feel timeless and honest.

    <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
    <p>
      This site is a curated archive of my work: weddings, graduations, sports, 
      creative projects, and more. Each gallery is designed to be simple, elegant, 
      and easy to explore. New collections will be added over time as I continue 
      to grow and experiment.
